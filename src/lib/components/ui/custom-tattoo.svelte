		If you would like a customized design we can schedule a free phone session. We can determine if
		I am a good fit for your tattoo. If so, we will talk about the design, size, placement, and any
		other details.

		A $75 deposit is required before I start designing and this will cover the drawing/design time.
		If you want a fixed price tattoo, I’ll give you a price range — usually between $100–$200. (IE:
		"Your tattoo will cost between $300 and $400."), which will in include the $75 drawing/design
		fee. If you are donig hourly, it will be $125 an hour plus the $75.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once the first drawing is ready, we’ll schedule a free in-person placement session to see how it
		flows and make any adjustments.
	</li>
	<li>
		If revisions are needed, I’ll send the updated version before we book. Once we finalize the
		design, I’ll give you a fixed price and we’ll book your tattoo. After this point, if anymore
		revisions are requested, I will do so with prepaid $25 an hour increments.
