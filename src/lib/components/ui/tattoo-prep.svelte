	During the early — and often middle — stages of your tattoo, I tend to be quiet and focused. I may
	not always be able to answer or hold a conversation — I need to give the tattoo my full attention at
	this stage. That said, as we get further along, I usually become more talkative and would genuinely
	enjoy getting to know you if you’re up for it! Of course, you’re just as welcome to stay quiet, relax,
	listen to headphones, etc. My priority is making sure you're as comfortable as possible, as long as
	it doesn’t interfere with the tattoo process. Also, though I may not be able to converse initially,
	talking around me doesn't distract me. You are welcome to bring a friend, or talk to others in the
	studio.
