				I love tattooing and creating art that people are excited about. I want people to feel
				welcome, so don't hesitate to ask any questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've been drawing and interested in art since I was a child. In addition to tattooing, I
				have worked as a web designer (and developer). I got an MFA in Painting in 2011, and still
				make art on the side. I also designed and developed this web application.

				I love hiking, jogging, and exploring the endless food carts and restaurants around
				Portland. In the summer I love going to Rooster Rock and Sauvie Island with my husband and
				friends, and occasionally a night out to bars and events. Iâ€™ve got a wide range of interests
				that include TV/film, music, Buddhism.
			</p>
			<p>
				I live in SE Portland with my husband Nick and our dog Jasper (AKA Jasper Johns, AKA Jasper
				James St. James Johns Snow).
