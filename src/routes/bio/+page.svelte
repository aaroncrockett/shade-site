				Aaron (ShadeToShade) has been interested in art and drawing since childhood and has a deep
				love for tattooing. He studied Graphic Design and Drawing in college and went on to earn an
				MFA in Painting. Over the years, he has worked as a web designer and developer, and taught
				2D design at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville as a graduate student.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aaron welcomes everyone, with a special shoutout to the queer and neurodivergent communities
				(he is queer and has ADHD himself). Outside the studio, he loves hiking, jogging, being
				outdoors, and exploring all the food and food carts around Portland. He has variety of
				interest that include TV/film, music, Buddhism, and video games when he has the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the early portion of a session, Aaron tends to stay quiet in order to focus. Heâ€™s
				often able to chat more as the tattoo progresses (if you prefer), but he never minds others
				talking. Clients are also welcome to bring a friend.
